Amidst the echoes of moments past,  
Where captured sights forever last.  
Not in scrolls nor written prose,  
But where thy vision often goes.  

Seek the vault where memories stay,  
In frames of light from yesterday.  
The key? 'Tis known, not new nor bold,  
A secret once whispered, now foretold.
